# Project Proposal: Newsworthy


## Project title

Newsworthy 

## What and why?

Information is more accessible than ever before.

Whether you're switching tabs between *The Wall Street Journal* and *The Economist*, or starting your day by opening up *Rolling Stone* and *Pitchfork*, staying up-to-date with all of your favorite media can be a bit of a hassle when getting your daily scoop involves opening multiple tabs. Rather than visitng each website, why not have everything in one place? Newsworthy provides users a personalized news feed, where users can view all of the latest information in one place. Daily news-reading is made simpler and more efficient, with one web app to visit to stay updated everyday. 


## For whom?
Newsworthy is for media consumers who tend to go to more than one place for their news. Whether this is because they want to diversify their news sources, or because they have a variety of hobby-based subscriptions to keep tabs on, the aim of the Newsworthy application is to simplify and streamline information.

## How?

The app should allow for user login, so that users can enter news sources they'd like to be displayed in their daily feed and this information can be saved. For each source, the program should scrape the site for the most newsworthy articles of the day, and display the a number of articles (which the user can decide) per source. Users should be able to scroll down the site and view the article's headline, subheader, and image, almost as if they are reading a blog. Clicking the article on Newsworthy should redirect the user to the actual article. 


## Scope

The application seems very doable to create split among 4-6 programmers. The foundation of the program is simple, but many features can be added if time allows. Some examples:

1. The program can allow the user to enter words of interest, where, if that word appears in a headline, it will be displayed in the users feed (e.g. "election") for further personalization. 

2. Likewise, certain keywords can be blacklisted.

3. The program can allow users to create multiple pages within their account for organization purposes. Consider a daytime scrolling feed and a nighttime feed. Or a current events feed and a music news feed. 

4. The program can allow users to pin a news source (or sources) so that it is always at the top of their feed. 

There are many possible features that can be added so that this application is not "too easy."
